  flavorTexts:
  - flavorName: Jansin Reactor No. 3
    flavorDesc: A local brand, Jansin has made some of the most popular fusion reactors
      ever to run on Talacan. Their popularity is in no small part due to the extended
      range they offer their pilots.
  - flavorName: Youngtide 86-H
    flavorDesc: Once highly experimental, the Youngtide 86-H set the standard for
      reactor tech in the Maelstrom Galaxy.
  - flavorName: Hellmuth Re-Caster
    flavorDesc: No one seems to know where this reactor came from, nor do they know
      how it was made. It's lengthy bill of sale, however, suggests a questionable,
      if storied, reliability.
  - flavorName: SOLD OUT
    flavorDesc: Even Ogden doesn't have anything more.
